References:

I did not use many references for this specific project
other than googling a few things like "how to increase
line space in p elements", for example.

Mainly the sites I referenced were W3schools and
the css documentation on Mozilla when performing
the aforementioned google searches.

UPDATE:

I used blog posts on stackoverflow to determine
why my HTML was not validating.
